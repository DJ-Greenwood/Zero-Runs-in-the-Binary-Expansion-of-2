This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of consecutive zero runs in the binary expansion of $\sqrt{2}$. I investigate the conjecture that for sufficiently large position $n$, there cannot be a run of zeros longer than $\log_2(n)$. Through both Diophantine approximation theory and computational verification, I explore the mathematical structure underlying this conjecture. My analysis combines theoretical frameworks with high-precision numerical investigations, revealing fundamental constraints that support the conjecture while identifying key patterns in the distribution of zero runs. I present novel algorithmic approaches, rigorous error analysis, and detailed scaling studies that provide strong evidence for the conjectureâ€™s validity.
